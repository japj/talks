# Renovate: a universal dependency update tool that fits into your workflow

Whatever programming languages you are using, whatever platform you are working on: manually keeping up to date with package dependencies is a pain. Renovate is an opensource, universal dependency update tool and can be configured to fit to your workflow.

In this session we will help you get a better understanding of what Renovate can do, what we learned from using it and hopefully give you a picture on how to apply it in your projects so you don't need to manually update packages anymore.
